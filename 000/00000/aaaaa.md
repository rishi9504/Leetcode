LeetCode problems often follow specific patterns that, once recognized, can significantly improve your problem-solving approach. Here are some of the most common patterns:

1. **Two Pointers** - Using two pointers to iterate through data structures. Variations include:
   - Fast and slow pointers (detecting cycles)
   - Left and right pointers (searching in sorted arrays)
   - Same direction pointers (sliding window)

2. **Sliding Window** - Maintaining a "window" of elements and sliding it through an array or string to find optimal subarrays/substrings.

3. **Binary Search** - Not just for sorted arrays, but also for search spaces like finding a minimum/maximum value that satisfies a condition.

4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - For level-by-level traversal of trees, graphs, and matrices. Often used for shortest path problems.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - For exploring paths, finding connected components, and backtracking problems.

6. **Dynamic Programming** - Breaking problems into overlapping subproblems:
   - Top-down (memoization)
   - Bottom-up (tabulation)

7. **Graph Algorithms** - Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Topological Sort, Union Find

8. **Greedy Algorithms** - Making locally optimal choices at each step.

9. **Heap/Priority Queue** - For problems involving "k largest/smallest" elements.

10. **Backtracking** - Systematically trying candidates and abandoning them when they don't work.
