   - Focus on problems frequently asked by the target companies.

---

## **5. Develop Problem-Solving Skills**
- **Framework for Solving Problems**:
  1. Understand the problem statement.
  2. Identify input/output and constraints.
  3. Brainstorm potential solutions.
  4. Write pseudocode.
  5. Optimize your solution.
  6. Implement and debug.

- **Focus on Writing Clean Code**:
  - Use meaningful variable names.
  - Avoid hardcoding.

## **7. Mock Interviews**
- **Pair Programming**:
  - Practice coding with a friend or mentor.
  - Simulate interview settings with a time constraint.
- **Online Platforms**:
  - Pramp, Interviewing.io, or LeetCode Mock Interviews.
- Review feedback and focus on weak areas.

---

## **8. Learn About Company-Specific Patterns**
- **Amazon**: Focus on arrays, strings, and dynamic programming.
- **Microsoft**: Emphasis on recursion, trees, and linked lists.

  - Prepare answers to questions like "Tell me about a challenge you faced."
  - Use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

- **CS Fundamentals**:
  - Review topics like Operating Systems, Networking, and Databases.

---

## **10. Stay Consistent and Track Progress**
- Use a spreadsheet or tools like **Trello** or **Notion** to track topics, problems solved, and your confidence level.
